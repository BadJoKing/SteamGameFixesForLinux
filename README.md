# SteamGameFixesForLinux
Just some fixes for problems I came across while trying to run Steam games on Linux
These may or may not work for you. They did for me (on Linux Mint 21.2 Cinnamon), but depending on your distro and general setup your mileage may vary. 

## Skyrim Special Edition (with AE DLC)
The Problems:
* The game would initially not launch at all, the fixes I found for that are:
    * Don't make your Steam Library on an NTFS-formatted Drive. **Use ext4**.
    * I also didn't find exfat (for compatibility with Windows) to be a viable option since the same "Not-Starting" problem would reappear.
    * Also, I added the following Launch Options
    ```
    WINEDLLOVERRIDES="xaudio2_7=n,b" PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=90 mesa_glthread=true %command%
    ```
    * Now, when you do your own research, maybe on [Skyrim SE's protondb](https://www.protondb.com/app/489830), you might find that some people added a ```PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%``` option to their game. I didn't, because for me it would cause the performance to be abysmal. We're talking 1 FPS **at most** throughout the opening scene, average was more like 5 SPF. Your mileage may vary though, so you might wanna try it out, just to see if it works for you or not.
    * _**UPDATE:**_ I installed another distro, this time **_arch based_** and my new launch options are as follows
 
   ```
   PROTON_USE_WINED3D11=1 WINEDLLOVERRIDES="xaudio2_7=n,b" PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=90 mesa_glthread=true %command%
   ```
    * You might also want to try **deleting the wineprefix** for Skyrim SE (located somewhere around /path/to/steamapps/compatdata/489830/pfx) and relaunching the game.
* Skyrim runs now, but there's some very annoying **hitching** happening
    * I'm on Linux Mint 21.2 cinnamon right now and cinnamon has this annoying quirk where it doesn' disable compositing for fullscreen apps by default, so the way to do exactly that was to go to ```System Settings -> General -> Disable compositing on fullscreen applications```.
* I want to run Skyrim with mods, but **skse64_loader.exe can't launch Skyrim**
    * You probably installed MO2 to manage your mods and if that's the case, **uninstall** it along with SKSE64 and then **reinstall MO2 _without_ manually installing SKSE64**. It turns out MO2 already installs skse on its own and the MO2-installed version somehow works better than the manually installed one. Now, I have no idea whether or not that's actually what fixed it, but I have no recollection of doing anything special to SKSE or MO2.
* Skyrim gets **stuck** at **"Running Install script (Microsoft Visual C++)"**:
    * Clear the download cache.

## Portal 2
The Problems:
* The game would start with a wrong aspect ratio and resolution
    * Add the Launch option ```-vulkan```
* The game stutters
    * Try [disabling compositing on fullscreen applications](https://linux-gaming.kwindu.eu/index.php?title=Compositor_(X11)#Cinnamon), if you are on Linux Mint Cinnamon.

## Satisfactory
The Problem:
* It just didn't launch. The fix for that was to add the following launch options: ```LD_BIND_NOW=1 VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 DXVK_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 %command% -NO_EOS_OVERLAY â€‘USEALLAVAILABLECORES -nosplash -nothreadtimeout```

## Icarus
The Problem:
* Didn't launch. Added Launch options: ```PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 %command%```

## Sniper Elite 4
The Problem:
* Didn't Launch:
   * If you're on the **amdvlk** driver:
      * Screw it and switch to radv, maybe install vkd3d via protontricks
      * If you want to really keep amdvlk just add the launch option ```PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%```, but prepare for immense performance issues even just hovering your mouse over menu items. I'm not 100% sure if redv is what did it, but it's at least about 90% and that's plenty enough for me to recommend switching.
   * If you're on radv:
      * You might wat to try installing it via lutris.
